# arma3-scripts
### Random scripts that I have made over the years for my Arma 3 community.
### (Very much a work-in-progress, much more to come but I need to remove the need for external dependencies on a lot of my existing stuff)
Most of the scripts are totally modular, meaning they can be dropped directly into your existing project or debug console.
Enjoy!
